# Number-Guesser
Number Guesser for Turing Mod 1


## Summary
Accomplishes all the requirements of the 3rd phase for this project.  
- User puts in a guess that is between or including the values of the numbers shown in the min/max possible guess fields.
- Each successful guess increases the range by 10 for min and max respectively.
- Input fields only allow numbers typed and if something is copy/pasted it should automatically reprosess to
- Buttons that are irrelevant are disabled, except for guess because that was not within the spec.

### Design
Best attempt at copying the spec exactly as it was laid out. 

### HTML
Markup is as minimal and logical as possible. Semantic tags are used but they could be improved greatly.  

### CSS
Has been refactored once.  Not clear where improvements could be made

### Javascript
Has been slightly refactored but could possibly be simplified.

### Known issues
No function to control min staying below max and vise versa.
Accessibility has not been utilized well
